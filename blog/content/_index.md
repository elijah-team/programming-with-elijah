<div class="front-page-introduction">

This blog series discusses the [Elijah Programming language](https://gitlab.com/elijah-team/elijah-lang/) developed on GitLab. It assumes that the reader is familiar with Object Oriented programming lnaguages and/or languages such as Java, C++ or Python, some of the primary influences for the language. (Ada and Eiffel will also do!)

Each post is a small tutorial and includes all needed code, so you can follow along if you like. The source code is also available in the corresponding [Github repository](https://github.com/elijah-team/programming-with-elijah/).
